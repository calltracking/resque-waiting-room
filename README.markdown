Resque Waiting Room
===================

A [Resque][rq] plugin. Requires Resque >= 1.19 and a >= 1.9 Ruby (MRI, JRuby or Rubinius).

If you want to limit the number of performs of a job for a given period, extend it
with this module.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'resque-waiting-room'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install resque-waiting-room

## Usage

#### Example -- 10 jobs processed every 30 seconds max

    require 'resque/plugins/waiting_room'

    class UpdateDataFromExternalAPI
      extend Resque::Plugins::WaitingRoom

      # This job can be performed 10 times every 30 seconds
      can_be_performed times: 10, period: 30

      def self.perform(repo_id)
        blah
      end
    end

If 10 UpdateDataFromExternalAPI jobs have been performed in 20
seconds, for the next 10 seconds UpdateDataFromExternalAPI jobs
will be placed in the waiting_room queue and processed when possible.
When the first 30 seconds are elapsed, the counter is set back to 0
and 10 jobs can be performed again.
You got to manually tweak the queue names in your workers though.

## Testing

We include a matcher

    require 'spec/support/matchers'

    describe MyJob do
      it 'is rate limited' do
        MyJob.should be_only_performed(times: 100, period: 300)
      end
    end

Run tests with the following command

    bundle exec rake
